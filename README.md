I'm an 18-year-old developer from India, just starting my journey in the world of tech. I recently completed my **Diploma in Computer Engineering**, which gave me a strong foundation in programming concepts.

I'm passionate about web development and am currently focused on building my skills to become a front-end developer.

## 🎯 My Goals

My goal is to build beautiful, user-friendly websites. In the coming months, I plan to:

* Start learning a modern front-end framework like React.
* Build and deploy my first major project: a personal portfolio website.
* Contribute to an open-source project, even in a small way.
